# What is this ?
Spleeter is Deezer's source separation library with pre-trained models written in Python and using Tensorflow. It facilitates the training of musical source separation models (assuming an isolated source data set is available) and provides state-of-the-art models already trained to perform different types of separation.

# How its works? ⚙️
Simple, just keeping following steps and execute in order all the cells for separate your favorite songs and testing what artificial intelligence can do

#### ***if all goes well, you should get files like these***

#### **(This Technology allows convert compatible files with FFMPEG like (wav, aiff, flac, mp3, m4a, ogg))**

## NOTE: Obviously this Technology was not created by me, 
***this repository only provides the link to a google colab notebook created by me, in which I explain in detail in English and Japanese language how to test this technology in a simpler way for anyone.***
