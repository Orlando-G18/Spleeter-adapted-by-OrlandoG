# Spleeter-adapted-by-OrlandoG
Adaptation created by me at Google Colab of Deezer's Spleeter technology.

# What is this ?
Spleeter is Deezer's source separation library with pre-trained models written in Python and using Tensorflow. It facilitates the training of musical source separation models (assuming an isolated source data set is available) and provides state-of-the-art models already trained to perform different types of separation.

# NOTE: Obviously this Technology was not created by me, 
this repository only provides the link to a google colab notebook created by me, in which I explain in detail in English and Japanese language how to test this technology in a simpler way for anyone.
